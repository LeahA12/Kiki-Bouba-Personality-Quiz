## PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE: 
The Kiki-Bouba effect is a non-linguistic phenomenon where most people associate a spiky, sharp shape with the name "Kiki" and a round, soft shape with the name "Bouba." <img width="617" height="440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3037ab3b-c4b7-4cbd-af67-b7701b9959b3" />

This software is a command-line personality quiz developed in Python that uses this concept. It prompts users to answer questions across several categories (movies, hobbies, music, and personality traits) to determine which archetype their personality aligns with. The final output provides a percentage-based score for each category, along with an overall percentage.
  
## FILES: 
* ```KikiVsBoubaPersonalityQuiz.py:``` This is the main Python script that contains the code for the quiz's questions, scoring system, and final output.
   
## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS: 
Execute the file using the command:
  ```
  python KikiVsBoubaPersonalityQuiz.py
  ```

## TESTING METHODOLOGY: 
1.  **Execution:** Run Python file as specified in the build instructions.
2.  **User Input:** Follow the prompts and answer each question on a scale of 1 to 10.
3. **Output Verification:**
   
   A. The program should print a percentage result for each category **(movies, hobbies, music, and personality traits)** for how Kiki or Bouba the user is. For example:
      ```
      Your tastes in movies are 38% Kiki!
      ```

   B. The program should print a percentage result for the overall score after confirming "yes". For example:
      ```
      You are overall 73% Kiki!
      ```

* This project was developed during a 24-hour hackathon
